				<h2>How I can help</h2>
				<p>
        While the lion's share of my time goes to <a href="http://dex.io">Dex.io</a>, there's always a bit free for startup community and internal innovation work. Here's how I can help:
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="row-fluid">
			<div class="span4">
				<h3>I'll run workshops or speak</h3>
				<p>
					I like working with the portfolio companies of accelerators, internal innovation teams, and students. My most popular workshops are:
				</p>
				<p>
				<ul>
					<li>Sales & custdev for techies <span class="light">30min-3hrs</span></li>
					<li>Programming for non-programers <span class="light">6hrs</span></li>
					<li>Lean startup strategy <span class="light">30min-3hrs</span></li>
					<li>Business model innovation <span class="light">1-3hrs</span></li>
          <li>Adventures in failure <span class="light">10-90min</span></li>
				</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					I strive to keep them buzzword-free, hands-on, and full of practical tools and novel case studies. 
				</p>
        <p>
          You can <a href="http://dex.io/robfitz/">book me to speak through Dex.io</a>.

				<h3>Accelerators: Help your founders waste fewer weeks</h3>
				<p>
        Have your teams ever come out of mentoring conversations more confused than they started? That's because they've mashed all the advice together into a single idea. They need idea detox.
        </p>
        <p>
        I work with half a dozen accelerator & support programs via <a href="http://foundercentric.com">foundercentric</a>, helping with curriculum design and to catch moments where founders are about to waste weeks. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Let's talk through what you're putting together.

				<h3>Corporations: Revamp internal innovation via the startup lens</h3>
				<p>
					Internal innovation is hard to foster but easy to kill. Our primary goal is to stop killing good ideas, which we'll do by looking at your business' constraints and the four big levers of innovation hygeine: budgeting, reporting, ownership, and speed. 
				</p>
				<p>
					You know your business better than anyone, so we can't tell you what to do. Instead, we'll look at what's working in the startup world and collaborate on figuring out which bits could move the needle for you.

      <h2>Stuff I've built</h2>
      <p>I like building stuff. Here are the projects and companies I've shipped recently. The longest took about 3 years and the quickest was 6 hours. Weirdly, I made money with the tiny one and lost a house on the big one. With the exception of Leancamp, I was either the co-founder or sole-founder for these. I also did some consulting gigs (most notably helping General Assembly expand into the UK) which I'm not listing here since they aren't mine.</p>
      <p>If there was programming, sales, or business to be done, I will have done a good share of it. If it involves design, somebody else did it -- probably <a href="http://hailpixel.com">Devin</a> or Laurence.</p>
